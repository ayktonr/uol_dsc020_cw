To do so, I have chosen the most winning team in the Premier League history, Manchester United (Premier League, 2020), and collected the past 10 seasons of their data containing the team statistics and the player nationalities per season. The data were downloaded as multiple .csv files from an extensive football website, FBREF(https://bit.ly/3nJYjq9), by selecting all 10 seasons separately. \n",

Because it is still using matplotlib as a base, works well with pandas, and provides user-friendly and informative statistical graphics(Seaborn,2020), I decided to apply it to my work.\n",
